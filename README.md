React-Native-Simple-Navigation is designed to provide a simple interface for rendering components based on user determined variables.

> This project is a work in progress. All contributions are welcome and feature requests also.

### Design Goals

---

#### Simple

React-Native-Simple-Navigation has it in the name. It is designed to be as simple as possible from the code base to integration and usage. With easy to use methods you can create a navigator which can handle route history, route switching, route pushing and 'go back' features.

#### Customisable

Thanks to the simplicity of the code base it is easy to build upon and add mix-ins to the code base for any use case.

### Future Plans

---

Future plans for the package include producing plugins (or mix-ins) to the code base, keeping the core as simple as possible and imporiving error handling/messaging.
